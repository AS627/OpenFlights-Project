# damianc2-yifanc23-achyuta2-asrigo2
Final Project for damianc2-yifanc23-achyuta2-asrigo2 
# How to Run the Code

We have provided a make file, so once you clone the repo, in the terminal, runnning make all should compile all the necessary files, after which you can run the program by ./openflights 

The way we have structured main.cpp is that once run, you will see two options, one for shortest route, and one with landmark. Please choose the desired choice by entering 1 or 2 

Once run, we have set up a non user input option for just seeing functionality which can be run by simply typing comp when prompted for user input. Enter the airport names as indicated in the terminal, and you should see an output in the terminal of the ideal flight path depending on the airports chosen
