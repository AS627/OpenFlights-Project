Constructor
1) Initialize Edges and graphs
2) Generate Map with routes and distances (weights)
3) Initialize all nodes to unvisited other than starting airport

ShortestPath Method
1) Find shortest path given start and end nodes 
- First consider direct path to starting nodes and record distance
  - check if (dist[visited] + cost[visited, unvisited] < distance[unvisited]) {
            set  dist[unvisited] = dist[visited] + cost[visited, unvisited]
-update visited nodes
