Final Project for damianc2-yifanc23-achyuta2-asrigo2 
# Team Contract

# Communication

**1) Team Meetings:** We plan to meet around once a week. We are also in person, so we have the option to meet in person, but will mainly discuss via Zoom, and meet in person when we need to. We have also made a discord channel which is our main source of communcation for discussion of ideas, progress. Our discord will be where we assign tasks and responsibilities. \
**2) Assistance:** The Discord channel we have made will be where we can discuss with each other. Anticipated response time should hopefully be within 24 hours but will most likely be sooner. In the unforseen event where someone is not responding, we can use email to contact. \
**3) Respect:** We will try and ensure that we respect everyone's opinion and thoughts to ensure our project takes the direction we all want it to take. We will also be respectful of everyones abilities and distribute work accordingly. We will ensure every team member is content with the work distribution and working on something they feel confident with.

# Collaboration

**1) Work Distribution:** For the first few weeks, we will come to a mutual agreement of equal assignment of work. Laying out the work that needs to get done for the week and agreeing on who will tackle what assignment will help minimize any confusion. On the basis of each person's capabilites and time commitments, we will then adjust the amount of commitment on a weekly basis. Needless to say, we will ensure that everyone does the same amount of work by the end of the project, even if on a week per week basis the workload is not equal. \
**2) Time Commitment:** As mentioned, we will try and take everyones other commitments into account. We plan to spend around 2-5 hours per week. As we plan to meet on the weekends, it is up to us team members to ensure we deliver what we are tasked to do. \
**3) Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts will be resolved by coming to an agreement with the entire group. If a team member is unable to accomplish his or her tasks and is late/absent from meetings they will be allowed a 2 day grace period to catch up on their incomplete work. However, if this continues to occur, there will be a discussion with the group.
